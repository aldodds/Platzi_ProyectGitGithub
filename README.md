# Sales Data Analysys

## Introduction

### Project objective
The objective of this project is to analyze sales and revenue data from a synthetically generated dataset to gain insights that can aid in business decision-making. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, variable type adjustments, detection and treatment of missing data, and identification of outliers.

### Tools used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, JupyterLab.

## Method
### Data description
Synthetic sales and income data were generated for a 12-month period (365 days) with the following characteristics:
- `Date`: Daily date range
- `Product`: Four different products labeled 'A,' 'B,' 'C,' and 'D'
- `Sales`: Random number of daily sales between 100 and 1,000
- `Revenue`: Random daily income between 1,000 and 5,000

### Variable type adjustments
The Date, Product, Sales, and Revenue variables have been confirmed to have the correct data types, making further analysis easier.

### Missing data treatment
No missing data were identified. The forward fill (ffill) method is available, ensuring data continuity

### Identification of Outliers
Several outliers were identified in both sales and income. These outliers were analyzed to understand possible reasons behind them.
